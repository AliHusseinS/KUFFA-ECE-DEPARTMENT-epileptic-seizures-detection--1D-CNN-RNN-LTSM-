## INTRODUCTION

Using EEG recordings, we were able to propose and show the use of deep neural networks in the
detection of epileptic seizures. Brain activity recognition was tested using two different supervised
learning algorithms with two ensemble classifiers, 1D-CNN produce the greatest performance of
accuracy above 99.6 in classification, in particular; To aid radiologists and clinicians in their
knowledge of seizure patients' EEG signal patterns, our models may be useful in clinical decision
making. Our models need to be refined further in order to attain the best possible results.
